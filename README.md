# PayStream - Decentralized Payroll Management System

A comprehensive Web3 payroll platform that revolutionizes how employers pay employees using cryptocurrency. PayStream enables cross-chain payments with intelligent routing, allowing employers to pay in any crypto while employees receive payments in their preferred token and blockchain of choice.

## üåü Key Features

### Multi-Chain Payment Flexibility with Intelligent Routing
- **Dual Preference System**: Employees set primary and secondary payment preferences for token type and blockchain network
- **Cross-Chain Cross-Token Transfers**: Since Avail's native transfer function doesn't support cross-chain cross-token transfers, we built custom smart contracts to enable ETH ‚Üî USDC swaps and facilitate multi-token swaps across different chains, expanding payment flexibility beyond Avail's native capabilities
- **Intelligent Fee Optimization**: Automatic comparison of transaction fees between preferences, routing through the most cost-effective option
- **Automatic Failsafe**: If primary preference fails, automatically retries on secondary preference
- **Smart Fee Comparison**: Evaluates total costs including gas prices, swap fees, and bridge costs


### PYUSD Integration & Fiat On/Off-Ramp
- **Accessible Onboarding**: Users without crypto can onramp directly using PayPal's PYUSD stablecoin
- **Cross-Chain Support**: PYUSD transfers between Ethereum and Solana via Layer Zero and Stargate Bridge
- **Complete Circular Flow**: Fiat ‚Üí PYUSD ‚Üí any crypto ‚Üí PYUSD ‚Üí fiat
- **One-Click Consolidation**: Gather balances from multiple chains and swap to PYUSD for easy off-ramping

### Advanced Transaction Tracking (Avail Intent Explorer)
- **Complete Payment Trail**: BlockScout integration showing full journey from employer to employee
- **Multi-Step Visibility**: Track deposits, conversions, and transfers with transaction hashes
- **Audit Compliance**: Full traceability for accounting and regulatory purposes

### One-Time Payment Links
- **QR Code & Link Generation**: Create shareable payment links for ad-hoc transactions
- **No Account Required**: Payers don't need employer accounts
- **Flexible Options**: Pay with any available crypto, recipient receives preferred currency


### Employee Management
- **Group-Based Organization**: Organize employees into payment groups for batch processing
- **Flexible Configuration**: Custom payment amounts and token preferences per employee
- **Complete Payment History**: Full audit trail of all transactions
- **Real-time Notifications**: Push-based updates for instant payment visibility

### Unified Balance & Gas Management
- **Multi-Chain Balance View**: See all holdings across supported chains in one dashboard
- **Gas Monitoring**: Automatic tracking of gas token balances across all active chains
- **Proactive Alerts**: Notifications when gas falls below operational thresholds
- **One-Click Refueling**: Simplified gas top-ups without manual bridge operations

### Payment Flow Pipeline

1. **Preference-Based Routing**: Employee preferences stored in Supabase with primary/secondary chain and token choices
2. **Fee Comparison Engine**: Queries gas prices and swap costs for both options, calculates total costs, selects optimal route
3. **Token Allowance Management**: Smart contract approvals set for solver interactions
4. **Avail Nexus Integration**: Deposit to solver ‚Üí currency conversion ‚Üí return transfer of converted funds
5. **Direct Transfer**: Final transfer to employee on chosen chain
6. **Failsafe Logic**: Automatic retry on secondary preference if primary fails
7. **Transaction Recording**: All steps logged to Supabase with BlockScout transaction hashes

### PYUSD Custom Implementation

Built custom smart contracts to bridge Avail Nexus limitations:
- **Swap Contracts**: Handle PYUSD ‚Üí ETH and PYUSD ‚Üí USDC conversions via DEX integrations
- **Multi-Step Flow**: PYUSD swapped to Avail-supported currency ‚Üí Avail Nexus processes payment ‚Üí Employee receives preferred token
- **Layer Zero Integration**: Enables PYUSD movement between Ethereum and Solana via Stargate
- **Consolidation Feature**: Gathers balances from multiple chains, swaps to PYUSD for PayPal off-ramp

### Real-Time Updates

Supabase real-time subscriptions provide instant payment notifications without polling, reducing server load and improving user experience.

## üéØ Notable Technical Achievements

1. **Avail Nexus Workarounds**: Custom smart contracts handle edge cases for unsupported token pairs and chains, preprocessing payments before entering the Avail ecosystem

2. **BlockScout Integration**: Scraped transaction data to extract solver addresses and intermediate details, creating custom visualization of complete payment journeys

3. **Fee Optimization Algorithm**: Real-time comparison engine evaluates multiple routes considering gas prices, swap fees, and bridge costs

4. **PYUSD Testnet Support**: Deployed custom contracts and integrated Stargate Bridge to enable PYUSD functionality across target chains

5. **Unified Balance Aggregation**: Single dashboard view of employer funds across all supported networks

6. **Failsafe Architecture**: Automatic fallback logic handles transaction failures gracefully with cost optimization
